# Pathfinder Visualizer

The Pathfinder Visualizer aims to allow users to see how an entity can find the goal in a maze with the presence of walls. In other words, the visualizer aims to demonstrate the various shortest-path algorithms that can be used in order to find the shortest distance between a start node and a goal node. 

The algorithms that will be demonstrated thus far will be:
	- Breadth-first Search
	- Depth-first Search
	- Dijkstra's Algorithm
	- A* Search Algorithm
